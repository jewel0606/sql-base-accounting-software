### 1. Trial Balance 

### 1.1 Trial Balance SQL Query


The following SQL view calculates a Trial Balance by aggregating journal entries, grouped by account code and type. It also includes a final row for the grand total.

```sql
WITH account_summary AS (
  SELECT
    coa.account_type,
    coa.account_sub1,
    coa.account_code,
    coa.account_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN jnl.dc = 'debit' THEN jnl.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_debit,
    SUM(CASE WHEN jnl.dc = 'credit' THEN jnl.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_credit,
    CASE
      WHEN coa.account_type IN ('asset', 'expense') THEN
        SUM(CASE WHEN jnl.dc = 'debit' THEN jnl.amount ELSE -jnl.amount END)
      ELSE
        SUM(CASE WHEN jnl.dc = 'credit' THEN jnl.amount ELSE -jnl.amount END)
    END AS final_balance
  FROM jnl
  JOIN chart_of_accounts coa ON jnl.account_code = coa.account_code
  GROUP BY coa.account_code, coa.account_name, coa.account_type
)
 
SELECT 
  account_type,
  account_name,
  total_debit,
  total_credit,
  final_balance FROM account_summary
union all
 
SELECT
  NULL AS account_type,
  'Grand Total' AS account_name,
  SUM(total_debit),
  SUM(total_credit),
  SUM(final_balance)
FROM account_summary
 
order by account_type;
```

### 2. financial statement summery

This SQL view generates the full financial statement summary directly from the journal table (jnl). It serves as an integrity check to determine whether the SQL queries are producing accurate financial reports or if the results are potentially misleading.

In accounting terms:

Asset = Liability - Equity - Income + Expense 


Therefore: Asset - Liability - Equity - Income + Expense = 0

This equation should yield zero if all postings are accurate, confirming the structural correctness of the report.

```sql
WITH account_summary AS (
  SELECT
    coa.account_code,
    coa.account_type,
    coa.account_category,

      WHEN coa.account_sub1 IS NULL AND coa.account_sub2 IS NULL THEN coa.account_name
